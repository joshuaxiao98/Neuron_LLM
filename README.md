# Neuron_LLM
1. run model2network.py to convert LLM models from pythia into complex networks
2. run data_preprocess.py to transform complex networks to input data of NMFA analysis
3. run NMFA_for_LLM.py to get the results of multifractal analysis of LLM networks
4. run NMFA_emergence_data.py to prepare the data for getiing the degree of emergence of LLM networks
5. before running NMFA_emergence_fig.py, run the command "git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia"
6. run NMFA_emergence_fig.py to get the comparison figures between degree of emergence and other metrics
